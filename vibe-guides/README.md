# Vibe Guides

> Common development patterns for vibe engineering

This directory contains practical guides for transforming vibe coding into production-grade engineering. Each guide represents battle-tested patterns that maintain the creative flow of vibe coding while ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## Core Principles

**Vibe engineering** preserves the intuitive, creative aspects of coding while introducing just enough structure to make systems sustainable. These guides follow three key principles:

1. **Flow-State Preservation** - Keep developers in creative flow
2. **Incremental Rigor** - Add structure progressively, not all at once  
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Codify what already works in practice

## =ï¿½ Guide Categories

### Development Patterns
- `rapid-prototyping.md` - From idea to working prototype in hours
- `spike-to-production.md` - Transitioning experimental code to production
- `intuitive-architecture.md` - Building systems that feel natural to extend

### Workflow Patterns  
- `vibe-driven-development.md` - Development methodology that follows creative energy
- `continuous-refactoring.md` - Keeping code clean without killing momentum
- `collaborative-vibing.md` - Team practices for maintaining collective flow

### Tool Integration
- `ai-assisted-vibing.md` - Leveraging AI tools while preserving human creativity
- `debugging-flow-states.md` - Troubleshooting without breaking concentration
- `version-control-for-vibes.md` - Git workflows that support experimental coding

## How to Use These Guides

Each guide is designed to be:
- **Immediately actionable** - Start applying concepts today
- **Contextually adaptable** - Principles over rigid processes
- **Community-refined** - Evolved through real-world usage

Start with the patterns that resonate with your current challenges, then gradually incorporate others as they become relevant.
